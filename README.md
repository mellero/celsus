Organizational tool for tabletop roleplaying games, developed in React

Started in 2019 while learning web development in my free time. The project has gone through multiple revisions, and here, as celsus, is re-initialized as a work in progress.
There has been a long break between my work on this project in 2019, and the current restart in September 2020. 

Much of this project is simply an excuse to test ideas and web technologies (React, React with hooks, MongoDB, Styled Components, etc).

I have ideas of either reimplementing the backend as SQL, or implementing only certain parts of the project as SQL, and the rest as Mongo.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
